# Atomium
[![Build Status](https://drone.fpfis.eu/api/badges/ec-europa/atomium/status.svg?branch=7.x-3.x)](https://drone.fpfis.eu/ec-europa/atomium) 
[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/ec-europa/atomium.svg)](https://github.com/ec-europa/atomium/issues?q=is:open+is:issue) 
[![Current Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/ec-europa/atomium.svg)](https://github.com/ec-europa/atomium/releases)

The Atomium theme is a Drupal 7 base theme.

The goal of this base theme is to rewrite most of the core theme functions of
Drupal and use proper render arrays and templates instead.
This will allow users to customize most of the elements in a custom
sub-theme using preprocess functions or by providing a custom template.

# Installation
[Download the theme manually](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/extending-drupal/installing-themes) or using [Drush](https://drupal.org/project/drush).

# Requirements
* PHP: greater or equal to version 5.6.
* Drupal 7: latest stable version,

[Go to top](#table-of-content)

# Activation
To enable the theme, go to **admin/appearance** and select
an Atomium based theme.

Atomium comes with "Atomium Bartik" sub-theme provided as an example, it can
be used as a starter-kit as well.
It is a fork of the Bartik core theme but based on Atomium.

The sub-theme provide examples of *preprocess* functions and templates so you
can craft your own theme quickly.

# Configuration
Atomium is not intended to be a full featured theme as you might find on
drupal.org, full of configurable settings and with a friendly user interface.
The sole purpose of this theme is to provide clean markup that you can
easily extend.

However, Atomium provides the following settings:

 - Enable theme debug mode.
 - Allow CSS double underscore.
 
As of Drupal 7.33, Drupal core has a theme debug mode that can be enabled and
disabled via the **theme_debug** variable.
Theme debug mode can be used to see possible template suggestions and the
locations of template files right in your HTML markup (as HTML comments).

As of Drupal 7.51, a new **allow_css_double_underscores** variable has been
added to allow for double underscores in CSS identifiers. In order to allow
CSS identifiers to contain double underscores (*.example__selector*) for
Drupal's [BEM-style naming standards](http://getbem.com/), this variable
can be set to TRUE.

# Contributing

Atomium is licenced under the [EUPL Licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Public_Licence).
All contributions to Atomium and its sub-themes are made on [Github](https://github.com/ec-europa/atomium), the main
Atomium repository.

To ensure its code quality, Atomium depends on: 
 - [GrumPHP](https://github.com/phpro/grumphp)
 - [Drupal conventions](https://github.com/drupol/drupal-conventions)

In order to use it and pass the automated tests, run:

## Using Docker Compose

A very easy and handy way to speed up the environment is by using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) and 
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Docker provides the necessary services and tools such as a web server and a database server to get the site running, 
regardless of your local host configuration.

### Requirements:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Configuration

By default, Docker Compose reads two files, a `docker-compose.yml` and an optional `docker-compose.override.yml` file.
By convention, the `docker-compose.yml` contains your base configuration and it is provided by default.
The override file, as its name implies, can contain configuration overrides for existing services or entirely new 
services.
If a service is defined in both files, Docker Compose merges the configurations.
By using `.env` file to define variables, such as PHP version, which allows a quick debug on docker-compose by running the
 below command without spinup the container and also avoid hard-coding values.
```bash
docker-compose config
``` 

Find more information on Docker Compose extension mechanism on [the official Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/).

### Usage

To start, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

It is advised to not daemonise `docker-compose` so it can be turned off (`CTRL+C`) quickly when it is not anymore needed.
However, there is an option to run docker on background by using the flag `-d`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then:

```bash
docker-compose exec web composer install
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/taskman drupal:site-install
```

Using default configuration, the development site files should be available in the `build` directory and the development site
should be available at: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/build](http://127.0.0.1:8080/build).

### Running the tests

To run the grumphp checks:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/grumphp run
```

To run the phpunit tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Without docker
`$ composer install`

This will:

  1. Build a target test site in `./build`
  2. Run `$ ./vendor/bin/taskman drupal:site-setup` which will setup site and tests configuration files, such as `phpunit.xml`

After that:

  1. Copy `taskman.yml.dist` into `taskman.yml` and customize it according to your local environment
  2. Install the site by running `$ ./vendor/bin/taskman drupal:site-install`

For a list of available commands run:

```
./vendor/bin/taskman
```

### Generate changelog

Place your token in `taskman.yml` file:

```yaml
github:
  token: YOUR_TOKEN
```

and then:

```bash
./vendor/bin/taskman github:changelog
```

# Extending

Atomium provides a way of extending just by creating some files without modifying
the core Atomium files.
Each theme definition, core or custom, is treated as a component.
You can find all the theme definitions in the *templates* directory of
each sub-theme.

To create a new theme definition:

 - Create a directory in *templates* and name it as you will. A good practice
 is to give it the name of the definition.
 - Create a file *[NAME-OF-THE-THEME-DEFINITION].component.inc*,
 - Create the function *[NAME-OF-THE-THEME]\_atomium_theme\_[NAME-OF-THE-THEME-DEFINITION]\()*,
 - Create a file *[NAME-OF-THE-THEME_DEFINITION].css* and/or *[NAME-OF-THE-THEME_DEFINITION].js* to get these files
  automatically loaded.
  
Atomium provides a custom page available on the path: **atomium-overview**.
This particular page is only available to users with _administer themes_ permission.

This page acts as a showcase page of components.
To add a component in there, your component needs to define two hooks:
 - hook_atomium_definition_hook().
   
   This hook allows you to define simply a component.
 - hook_atomium_definition_form_hook().
   
   This hook allows you to define one or multiple components in a Drupal form.
   
For a better understanding and examples, see the [atomium.api.php](https://github.com/ec-europa/atomium/blob/7.x-1.x/atomium/atomium.api.php) file.
  
Do not forget to clear the cache every time a new theme definition or
process/preprocess is added or removed.

# Developer's note

During the development of this project, a lot of time has been put into
analyzing how Drupal's core functions were implemented and how to improve them
for better customization.

A good example of this is the breadcrumb generation.

Let's analyse how it is currently done in Drupal and how it is implemented on this project.

````php
$variables['breadcrumb'] = theme('breadcrumb', array('breadcrumb' => drupal_get_breadcrumb()));
````

By default, Drupal uses the function *drupal_get_breadcrumb()* in its
*template_process_page()* hook.

The function *drupal_get_breadcrumb()* returns raw HTML.
Thus, it is impossible to alter the breadcrumbs links properly.

In order to get a render array, it requires a deeper analyse and rewrite functions
accordingly.

*drupal_get_breadcrumb()* calls *menu_get_active_breadcrumb()*.
This is actually the function that returns the HTML.

There is no way to alter the result of that function as it returns an array of
raw HTML links.

Unfortunately, in order to change this behaviour, two extra
functions were implemented in Atomium, also the way
the breadcrumb is generated changed, by overriding the default one as shown below:

````php
  $variables['breadcrumb'] = array(
    '#theme' => array('breadcrumb'),
    '#breadcrumb' => atomium_drupal_get_breadcrumb(),
  );
````

*atomium_drupal_get_breadcrumb()* is an Atomium internal function written only
for the breadcrumb handling. Instead of calling *menu_get_active_breadcrumb()*,
it calls *atomium_menu_get_active_breadcrumb()* which is also a
custom Atomium function that, instead of returning an array of raw HTML links,
returns an array of render arrays.

This is why, in *page.tpl.php*, instead of writing:

````php
<?php print $breadcrumb; ?>
````

You have to use:

````php
<?php print render($breadcrumb); ?>
````

The rendering process is at the very end of the Drupal's chain of preprocess,
process and render functions.
